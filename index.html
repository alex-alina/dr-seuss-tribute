        <h2>Here's a short biography of Dr. Seuss's life:</h2>
        <p><strong>Theodor Seuss Geisel</strong> was an American author best known for authoring more than 60 children's books under the pen name <strong>Doctor Seuss</strong> (abbreviated Dr. Seuss). His work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time.</p>
        <p><strong>Geisel</strong> was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts and attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. After graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a PhD in English literature.</p>
        <p>He left Oxford in 1927, without earning a degree, to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Life</em>, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for <em>FLIT</em> and <em>Standard Oil</em>, and as a political cartoonist for the <em>New York</em> newspaper.</p>
        <p><strong>Dr. Seuss</strong> published his first children's book <em>And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</em> in <strong>1937</strong>, but as World War II began, he turned to political cartoons, drawing over 400 in two years as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning <em>New York City</em> daily newspaper.</p>
        <p>After the war, Geisel and his wife moved to La Jolla, California, where he returned to writing children's books. There he wrote many of his most appreciated books.</p>
        <p><strong>Geisel</strong> died of oral cancer on September 24, 1991 at his home in La Jolla at the age of 87.</p>
        <h2>Some of his most appreciated publications are:</h2>
